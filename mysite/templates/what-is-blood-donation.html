    <h1>What is blood donation?</h1>

    <p>A <span class="highlight">blood donation</span> occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called <span class="highlight">fractionation</span> (separation of whole-blood components). Donation may be of <span class="highlight">whole blood (WB)</span>, or of specific components directly (the latter called <span class="highlight">apheresis</span>). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.</p>

    <p>Today in the developed world, most <span class="highlight">blood donors</span> are unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In some countries, supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (<span class="highlight">directed donation</span>). Many donors donate as an act of charity, but in countries that allow <span class="highlight">paid donation</span>, some donors are paid, and sometimes there are other incentives like paid time off. Donors can also donate blood for their own future use (<span class="highlight">autologous donation</span>). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors may bruise or feel faint afterward.</p>

    <p>Potential donors are evaluated to ensure their blood is safe to use. The screening includes testing for diseases like <span class="highlight">HIV</span> and <span class="highlight">viral hepatitis</span>. Donors must also answer questions about their <span class="highlight">medical history</span> and take a short <span class="highlight">physical exam</span> to confirm it's safe for them to donate.</p>

    <p>Donation frequency depends on the component donated and local laws. For example, in the <span class="highlight">United States</span>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Whole blood</strong>: every 8 weeks (56 days)</li>
        <li><strong>Plateletpheresis</strong>: every 7 days</li>
        <li><strong>Plasmapheresis</strong>: twice every 7 days</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The amount of blood drawn and the methods vary. Blood may be collected <span class="highlight">manually</span> or with <span class="highlight">automated equipment</span>. Most blood components have a short shelf life, making it hard to maintain a constant supply. This has led to interest in <span class="highlight">autotransfusion</span>, where a patient’s blood is collected during surgery and reused, or is self-donated in advance. Though “donation” usually means giving to others, in this case, it includes giving to one’s self.</p>
